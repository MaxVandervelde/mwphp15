<p>What runs php.net? Where do the servers come from and who runs them? Who writes the php.net website? How about the
    docs, the tests (that are written in PHP) Who takes care of bug and pull request triage? The answer is - VOLUNTEERS
    There's a lot to running a large successful open source project besides just dealing with the source code. There's
    also a lot to deal with politically and people are often amazed when they offer to rewrite the core of something and
    the current users flame them out of existence. Learn ways you can help up and get involved with open source (even
    touching C or fighting with toxic mailing lists) and learn how it can help your career and your people skills.</p>
