<p>One thing that most programmers do not take the time to understand is the servers that their application lives on.
    Most know a smattering of Apache configs, PHP configs, and basic information about the OS. This talk will deal with
    looking at tools that can help you quickly set up a server and how it can help you be a better developer. We&#39;ll look
    at tools like Puppet for server management, OSSEC for log management, different command line tools, and Nagios/Monit
    for system monitoring.</p>
