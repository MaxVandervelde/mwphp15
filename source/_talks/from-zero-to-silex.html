<p>Silex: It's the biggest microframework you'll ever use. Or maybe the most lightweight framework you'll ever use. Or
    it's just Symfony Junior. So what is it? Silex is, simply, a ready-made request/response pipeline built on the
    Symfony components, ready for you to build... whatever. Unlike fullstack frameworks it doesn't imply a certain model
    or approach, and lets you define your own architecture, for better or worse. In this session we will, before your
    very eyes, build up a small but functional Silex application from nothing but a composer.json file to a fully
    capable REST service. Along the way we'll show how to keep you system decoupled and testable, without falling into
    the "anonymous callbacks are so easy; wait, now I can't test anything" trap. And best of all, it will offer a
    direction for people who want to do more than "hello world" but don't know where to start without the pre-build
    scaffolding that a fullstack framework would provide.</p>
