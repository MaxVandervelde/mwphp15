<p>Silex: It&#39;s the biggest microframework you&#39;ll ever use. Or maybe the most lightweight framework you&#39;ll ever use. Or
    it&#39;s just Symfony Junior. So what is it? Silex is, simply, a ready-made request/response pipeline built on the
    Symfony components, ready for you to build... whatever. Unlike fullstack frameworks it doesn&#39;t imply a certain model
    or approach, and lets you define your own architecture, for better or worse. In this session we will, before your
    very eyes, build up a small but functional Silex application from nothing but a composer.json file to a fully
    capable REST service. Along the way we&#39;ll show how to keep you system decoupled and testable, without falling into
    the &ldquo;anonymous callbacks are so easy; wait, now I can&#39;t test anything&rdquo; trap. And best of all, it will offer a
    direction for people who want to do more than &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; but don&#39;t know where to start without the pre-build
    scaffolding that a fullstack framework would provide.</p>
