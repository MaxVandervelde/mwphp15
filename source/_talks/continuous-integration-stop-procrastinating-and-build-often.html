<p>Continuous Integration (CI) is quickly becoming a de-facto standard for PHP development teams. CI allows for more
    frequent deployments and more ambitious refactoring, and significantly reduces the number of bugs deployed to
    production. Oftentimes, the biggest obstacle to implementing CI is the unknown. In this session, we will de-mystify

    using Jenkins, PHPUnit, Selenium, and chat.</p>
