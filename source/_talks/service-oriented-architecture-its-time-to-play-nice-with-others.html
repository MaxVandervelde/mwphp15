<p>Chances are your application serves multiple purposes. It supplies data to a mobile application, it might supply data
    to a node.js application, it could be a backend only application and more. SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) is a
    necessary paradigm and pattern to build your applications in such a way to play well with others. APIs may be the
    ultimate part of the puzzle but designing your architecture in a service oriented way will help achieve building
    your API in a far quicker way.</p>
