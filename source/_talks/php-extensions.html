<p>Ever had a need for some library in C in your PHP code? Or want to hook into the engine to do evil? Or maybe you just
    want to make some part of PHP better. And then you say &ldquo;but I don&#39;t know enough C&rdquo;. PHP extensions are actually
    quite easy to write, even for those with only the smallest amount of C knowledge, if you know the secret
    incantations. Write your own extension in this step by step tutorial which assumes you know nothing of PHP
    internals, the very basics of C syntax and little more, and have the ability to type &ldquo;./configure && make && make
    install && make test&rdquo;</p>
