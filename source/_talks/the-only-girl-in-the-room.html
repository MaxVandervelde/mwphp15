<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/html">The news has been filled with stories of sexism in tech. These stories cover major, obvious instances that,
    hopefully, are not common in our everyday lives. So why is sexism (and inclusion for everyone) getting so much
    attention? Have you ever thought &ldquo;I believe that it&#39;s tougher and I want to help, but I&#39;ve never seen it happen?&rdquo;
    Our day-to-day definition of normal is not as inclusive as we think it is. Come get an inside look at what kinds of
    daily things happen that make it very difficult to be a woman in tech.</p>
