<p>Developers have quite the reputation. Depending on the kind of environment you work in, the title &ldquo;Developer&rdquo; comes
    with some baggage. Clients, managers, designers, and even your end users can immediately assume quite a bit about
    you. They may have the &ldquo;brogrammer&rdquo; flash before their eyes and expect you to be very, very good at code but very,
    very bad at communicating. Your voice may not be heard when it comes to design decisions and you may never even meet
    an end user. These assumptions can be dangerous and can even keep us from building the best software we can. Though
    the stereotype may be exactly what some devs have signed up for, others may be ready to wear the UX or user testing
    hat. In this talk, we&#39;ll chat about ways to navigate your team structure and get involved with design, users, and
    dust off those soft skills few folks expect us to have.</p>
