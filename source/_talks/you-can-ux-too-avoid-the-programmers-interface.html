<p>Programmers have a bad reputation when it comes to UX, but it&#39;s time to set the record straight: It isn&#39;t because we
    don&#39;t care! It&#39;s because we fall in the trap of thinking we can design a user interface and write it at the same
    time when, the truth is, these processes require different kinds of thinking. But learning how to unlock that part
    of your brain is worth it - and you&#39;ll be surprised at what you already know. From one developer to another, this
    talk will discuss why you should think critically about the interfaces you write and give you some strategies you
    can start applying right away, whether you&#39;re implementing on your own or working with a UX professional. This talk
    is aimed at developers, both front-end and server-side, who implement user interfaces but may not have training in
    UX. Because really, ALL programmers implement user interfaces. Sometimes the user is another developer (in the case
    of an API) or a more advanced user (for a command-line tool), but don&#39;t kid yourself: all software has users.</p>
