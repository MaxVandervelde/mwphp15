<p>It&#39;s a tough world out there. There are so many new things to learn, and the list of need-to-knows changes every
    day. How do you keep up? How do you move ahead? Find a mentor - but wait! Isn&#39;t this a dog-eat-dog field where
    admitting you don&#39;t know something is the death of your career? Maybe back in 1995, but this is the new age of open
    source. Collaboration and sharing of information reigns. Find a mentor to help you excel, but more importantly, find
    someone to mentor. Being a mentor is challenging, rewarding, and keeps you on your toes. Learn what it takes to find
    a mentor, be a good mentor, and what tools can help you build your mentoring relationship.</p>
