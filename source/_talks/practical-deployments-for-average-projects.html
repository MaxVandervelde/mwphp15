<p>It makes a lot of sense to have a fully automated continuous integration system for your large SaaS product. But what
    about your average web project? Does this sort of infrastructure make sense for your company website or even your
    friend&#39;s blog? After all, FTP works fine, right? Well you might be surprised to learn how many awesome tools are
    available for even the smallest projects. In this talk I&#39;ll outline some practical approaches to automating your
    &ldquo;average project&rdquo; deployments. This includes how to actually copy your files to your deployment server, run your
    tests, install Composer dependencies, complete database migrations and more.</p>
