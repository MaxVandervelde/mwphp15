<p>As web developers, we all end up coming in contact with software we didn't write, be it to use in our own projects or
    to modify in some way to satisfy a need for ourselves or a client. We might even be distrubuting a library or an
    application. What we may not realize is that licensing is a very important idea which guides what we can and cannot
    use in our own software. We'll navigate the murky waters of Open Source Licensing and copyright as it relates to
    developers.</p>
