<p>As web developers, we all end up coming in contact with software we didn&#39;t write, be it to use in our own projects or
    to modify in some way to satisfy a need for ourselves or a client. We might even be distributing a library or an
    application. What we may not realize is that licensing is a very important idea which guides what we can and cannot
    use in our own software. We&#39;ll navigate the murky waters of Open Source Licensing and copyright as it relates to
    developers.</p>
