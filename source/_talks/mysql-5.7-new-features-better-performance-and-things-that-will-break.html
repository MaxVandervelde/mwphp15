<p>MySQL 5.6 was our best release ever but 5.7 is rapidly approaching. It will bring with it tighter security, better
    performance, stronger replication, and there is the new Fabric shard/high-availability tool. But we are changing
    some defaults that may affect you. For instance, the default SQL mode is STRICT, which will hurt WordPress installations.
    We have an HTTP plugin that will send JSON to your mobile devices, better instrumentation for low level monitoring,
    and can do multi-source replication. Come to this session to learn about the new features, what has been deprecated,
    and best practices before you have to upgrade to MySQL 5.7</p>
