<p>MySQL 5.6 was our best release ever but 5.7 is rapidly approaching. It will high tighter security, better
    performance, stronger replication, and there is the new Fabric shard/high-availability tool. But we are changing
    some defaults that may effect you, like the default SQL mode is STRICT which will hurt you Wordpress installations.
    We have a HTTP plugin that will send JSON to your mobile devices, better instrumentation for low level monitoring,
    and can do multi-source replication. Come to this session to learn about the new features, what has been deprecated,
    and best practices before you have to upgrade to MySQL 5.7</p>
