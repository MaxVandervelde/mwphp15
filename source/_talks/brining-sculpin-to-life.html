<p>Are you curious about the process of creating an open-source application from scratch? Are you asking questions like,
    "should I contribute to an existing project instead?" or "does the world really need yet another [insert your idea
    here]?" Maybe you are wrestling with, "am I good enough?" or "what if nobody wants to use it?" Once you decide to go
    for it, a whole new round of decisions need to be made like "which framework should I use?" , "should I roll
    everything from scratch?" or "should I use some standalone libraries to help me?" And this is before you've even
    written any code! Come see how this scenario played out for Sculpin (<a href="http://sculpin.io">sculpin.io</a>). Learn about the motivations for
    creating yet another static site generator for PHP. Find out about the questions and barriers that almost kept
    Sculpin from ever being created. Discover the technology decisions that needed to be made and how those have changed
    over time. Walk away knowing more about what it was like for one open-source application to grow from idea to a
    full-fledged application with actual users.</p>
