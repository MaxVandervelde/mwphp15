<p>WordPress currently powers over 1/5th of the internet and is growing. Historically, people think of WordPress as a
    blogging platform or use it as a CMS, but can this tool known and used by millions of people also be used to create
    complex applications? WordPress is familiar, easy to use, actively developed and supported, and has a powerful
    codebase that allows one to quickly develop applications and websites. These things make WordPress a great option to
    develop you next application. We will walk through examples of WordPress&#39;s use to create applications and very
    complex sites and then dive into the internals of WordPress that make this happen including: Custom Data Types, 
    WordPress Hooks, Database Interactions, Connecting to Remote APIs, The WordPress JSON API, Caching, Extensibility,
    User and Role Management, Templates, and URL Rewriting.</p>
