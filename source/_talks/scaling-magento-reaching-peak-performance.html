<p>Building a cluster to support Magento is easy and makes a good example for scalable web application platforms.</p>

<p>I will walk through a typical Magento Cluster setup and provide Vagrant/Puppet configurations for the basic setup. Then I will cover some of the hardware and cloud resources that are required as the platform grows. We will move onto application choices, and some of the development, testing and deployment strategies that are required to have a successful clustered platform.</p>
