<p>You can git pull, merge, and even force-push with the best of them, but what’s really going on in that .git folder?
    What&#39;s a commit, and how does it know where it came from? What does checking out a tag have to do with detaching
    your head, and why does rebase mess things up so thoroughly? In this talk, we&#39;ll get inside individual commits and
    learn to push them around, then zoom out to the whole repository. Come find out how Git’s glorified game of
    Connect-the-Dots can improve the development workflow and collaboration opportunities for your whole team!</p>
