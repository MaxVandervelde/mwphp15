Sponsors play a huge role in making Midwest PHP possible. Through their generous contributions, we've been fortunate to invite
industry leaders to come and share their knowledge and expertise about PHP and related technologies, and provide numerous
networking opportunities for our attendees and partners &mdash; all for a fraction of the cost of other technology conferences.

If your organization is interested in sponsoring the Midwest PHP 2015 Conference, please contact us at info@midwestphp.org, and
we'll send you a copy of our sponsorship prospectus.
