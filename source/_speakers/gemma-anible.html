<p>Gemma is a software engineer, video gamer and recovering classical violinist who has been developing PHP web
    applications since before PHP5 (and applications in C, .NET and Delphi since before then). She is passionate about
    using pragmatic processes and tooling to support developers of all types and skillsets, and her level of excitement
    over learning new dev technology tends to correlate strongly with her level of caffeination. Gemma and her husband
    live with their two dogs in New Mexico, where they climb volcanoes for fun.</p>
