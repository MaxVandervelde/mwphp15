<p>Larry Garfield has been building web sites since he was a sophomore in high school, which is longer ago than he'd
    like to admit. As a freelancer he worked mostly for Chicago-area politicians before graduating to full time
    consulting with Palantir.net. At Palantir, Larry is a Senior Architect and Community Lead, developing solutions for
    medium to large cultural and educational institutions. He also works to represent both Palantir and Drupal in the
    broader developer community. Larry is an active Drupal core contributor, including the principle architect of the
    Drupal 7 database system and the Drupal 8 Web Services Lead. He is also a member of the Advisory Board of the Drupal
    Association and the Drupal representative to the Framework Interoperability Group. Larry holds a Masterâ€™s degree in
    Computer Science from DePaul University. Larry is a co-author of "Drupal 7 Module Development" from Packt
    Publishing. He blogs at both http://www.palantir.net/ and http://www.garfieldtech.com/.</p>
