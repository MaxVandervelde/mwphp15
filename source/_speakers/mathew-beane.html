<p>Mathew has been fascinated with building and programming computers since his early days of upgrading an 8086 to an
    80386. Working initially in the video game industry building servers and managing server rooms, Mat shifted his focus
    to PHP programming in early 2000. With over a decade of experience in eCommerce, Mat is now Director of Systems
    Engineering at Robofirm and a Magento Certified developer, where he enjoys scaling enterprise clientele on the
    Magento eCommerce platform. When he's not programming, you will find Mat spending time with his family, making
    music, or tinkering in aquaponics.</p>
