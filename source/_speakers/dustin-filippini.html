<p>Dustin Filippini is a Web Developer with WebDevStudios building high end websites and web applications using
    WordPress as a framework. He started his programming life as a child on a Tandy 1000 computer in the 80s, was banned
    from the high school library for "hacking" the computers, and has been working with the web since the late 90s.
    Mainly self taught in PHP, JavaScript, and other web technologies, Dustin found his niche with WordPress after
    finding the amazing community surrounding the project. He now loves building complex applications with what many
    think is merely a blog platform and giving back to the WordPress community and the local Milwaukee tech community by
    organizing WordCamp Milwaukee, the local WordPress Meetup, and the JavaScript User Group. You can also find him
    frequently at the local PHP group and other meetups. Dustin lives in the Milwaukee area and enjoys spending time
    with his 2 year old daughter, wife, and two dogs and rooting for the Packers and Brewers.</p>
