<p>Amy is an extroverted Web Application Developer with a traditional Computer Science background and a passion for
    technology, people, and breaking stereotypes. She shares the same “built my first site in Notepad” story as most of
    her colleagues and is a self-proclaimed geek with an interest in all things tech. She is currently a developer at
    White House Custom Colour and with a history of hybrid roles, Amy has managed to avoid choosing between the
    front-end and the back-end – allowing her to establish a skill-set ranging from PHP to CSS to MySQL to JavsScript.
    Amy led the legacy application rewrite of one of Fisdap’s flagship products and discovered the natural high sparked
    by a dedicated team and a clean, commented codebase.</p>
