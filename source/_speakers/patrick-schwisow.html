<p>Patrick has been into web technologies since the "bad old days" when animated GIFs were required on all sites and the
    BLINK tag still had some supporters. He suffered through several years of procedural programming in PHP4 before
    discovering the glories of OOP in PHP5. Patrick is a Software Engineer at Shutterstock, with experience in Doctrine,
    Symfony, and several less fun technologies. After hours, he's the founder and organizer of the Lake / Kenosha County
    PHP Users Group.</p>
