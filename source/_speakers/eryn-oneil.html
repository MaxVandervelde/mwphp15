<p>Eryn O'Neil is a web developer and technical lead at Clockwork Active Media in Minneapolis, MN. As part of an
    interactive agency, she has worked on everything from e-commerce to online promotions to creating and maintaining an
    internal framework and CMS. Her philosophy is to build software by placing humans first: both the people who will
    use it and the developers who will build it alongside you (and maintain it afterwards). Based in Minneapolis, MN,
    Eryn spends most of her free time swing and blues dancing, rock climbing, and wishing it weren't snowing.</p>
