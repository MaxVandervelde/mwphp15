The Midwest PHP Conference started in 2012 with the idea of bringing experts from around the globe to Minneapolis for two days to share best practices, ideas, and techniques about building state-of-the-art software applications.

Not just about PHP, Midwest PHP includes a wide range of topics of interest to the modern developer, such as JavaScript, Frameworks, Content Management Systems, Database & Server Administration, DevOps, Mobile Development, plus an assortment of non-technical and business-relevant skills.

Our aim is to provide exceptional content and networking opportunities to help maximize the value for our 200+ attendees, presenters, and sponsors alike.
