<p>In 2006, Sandy Dischinger and Deb Heuer founded VALERE (vaˈlere) with the firm belief that why and how you do
    business is as important as what you deliver. With over 20 years of corporate experience, they knew that it was
    possible to deliver exceptional talent and services to clients while maintaining high standards of business
    practice, work relationships, and corporate citizenship. The Latin term valere — &ldquo;strength,&rdquo; &ldquo;worthiness&rdquo;
    and
    &ldquo;health&rdquo;—expresses the principles that define the culture clients and consultants experience when
    working with
    VALERE:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Respectful relationships</li>
    <li>Open and responsive communication</li>
    <li>Accountability and dependability</li>
    <li>Community engagement</li>
</ul>

<p>VALERE is located in Minnesota with consultants delivering creative and information technology services to clients
    in retail, healthcare, finance, advertising and e-commerce industries. We call the Twin Cities home and strive to
    make our community better by giving back.</p>


<p><strong>CLIENTS:</strong> Our clients will tell you that what sets VALERE apart from other consulting firms is the personal touch and
    responsiveness. We understand your business and work to find consultants that meet your needs and fit your
    culture.</p>

<p><strong>CONSULTANTS:</strong> 86% of consultants say working at VALERE is more satisfying than other places they’ve worked. (100% of
    staff agree)</p>

<p><strong>COMMUNITY:</strong> We heart the Twin Cities and giving back expresses a core value. We urge consultants to do the same and
    provide opportunities for them to do so.</p>
